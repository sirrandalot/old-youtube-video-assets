Thanks for checking this out!
The file which has the game is called "Environment Test.blend".
If you open it up, you should be able to hit "P" and play straight away.
Have fun :)
Quick note, the game isn't super well optimized, so in order to get it to run on a slower computer,
or if you have recording software running, you might need to mess around with it.
Otherwise, everything should work fine.

Control reminders:
Activate: Left Click or press "F"
Tool Tips: Hold "T" with a tool in hand
