#Teleporting script for the game engine
#Created in Blender 2.74 by sirrandalot
#
#For this script to run properly, the sensor object must
#a boolean property named 'SENS' as well as 3 floats called 
#'x', 'y', and 'z', the camera this is attached to
#must have a radar sensor called 'Radar', and the player object
#must be called 'Player'

#Feel free to modify this script to suit your needs,
#this is the bare minimum required
